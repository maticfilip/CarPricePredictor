# CarPricePredictor
Project for a uni class called Znanstveno programiranje (Scientific programming). It is a simple used car price predictor using linear regression. Not completely usable because the datased is quite old. 
Project visualizes all neccessities from the EDA perspective, cleans up the dataset and creates a model. Notebook is interactive so there is no need to change the code to access results.
Also, a small web scraper is included inside the project to showcase potential collecting of newer car info.
